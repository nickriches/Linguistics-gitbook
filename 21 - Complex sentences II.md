# The goodenough model

1. No head injury is too trivial to ignore

We interpret this sentence as meaning "No head injury should be ignored no matter how trivial". It actually means "Every head injury should be ignored no matter how trivial". Do demonstrate this, we can compare it with the sentence

1. No doughnut is too fattening to eat = Every doughnut should be eaten no matter how fattening.

How does this comprehension "error" arise? The structure is relatively complex and involves a form of double negation ("No" = negative, and "ignore", though not grammatically negative, nonetheless means an absence of attention). When faced with a complex structure we "fall back on" our lexical and encyclopaedic knowledge (e.g. the fact that head injuries are serious and therefore shouldn't be ignored). A model which accounts for this is Fernanda Ferriera's "Goodenough model" which argues that when interpreting difficulties sentences we often go for gist or overall meaning, rather than conducting a detailed analyses. In other words, we build a representation which is "good enough" to facilitate communication between the speakers, and in doing so minimise processing effort.

This is an interesting approach because it runs counter to a lot of the researcher suggesting that we conduct a detailed parse

# Defining complexity

## (1) Canonicity

"Canonical" means "standard" or "most-frequently used". Most languages have a "canonical" word order, i.e. a most frequently used word order. In English, the most canonical word order is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). Across languages there is a tendency to place the Subject before the Object and to place the Verb before the Object. However, some languages buck this trend, e.g. Hixkarayana is OVS, though this word order is only found for 1% of the world's languages.

We can define canonicity in syntactic terms of semantic terms. If a sentence is syntactically canonical the Subject comes before the Object. Examples of **non**-canonical sentences (where the Object comes before the Subject) are

1. **The dog$_{Od}$** that **the man$_{S}$** chased _ was brown (Object relative)
2. **Which dog$_{Od}$** was **the man$_{S}$** chasing? (Object question)

In semantically canonical sentence, the Subject is aligned with the most agentive argument, e.g. one which has control over the event. Typically the subject is the Agent. In sentences which are non-semantically canonical, the Subject is mapped to the least agentive argument, e.g.

1. **The dog$_{PAT.}$** was chased by **the cat$_{AG.}$**. (Passive)

Generally-speaking non-canonical sentences are more difficult to understand / produce than canonical sentences. This effect is amplified in language-impaired individuals, e.g. children with language disorders and adults with aphasia.
